        <h1 id="big_letter">Welcome to my site. Please 
        come in and stay awhile.</h1>
      <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
        holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my
        favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.<br><br>
        If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite
        Halloween
        pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep 
        you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
